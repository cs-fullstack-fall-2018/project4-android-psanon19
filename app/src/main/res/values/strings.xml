        <item>1</item>
        <item>Mix cottage cheese, 1 clove of garlic, cardamom and cloves thoroughly in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
            Heat the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Stir in the onion, ginger, green chilli and 2 cloves of garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the spinach and cook until just wilted. Drain any excess liquid, and serve the spinach mixture over the seasoned cottage cheese.
            Preheat the oven to 170 C / Gas 3. Line a round baking tin with baking parchment.
            Combine all of the ingredients into a mixing bowl and stir well. Pour into the prepared baking tin. Cover the tin lightly with aluminium foil.
            Bake in a preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool fully in the tin. Carefully transfer the pudding to a serving plate and chill in the fridge for 1 hour. Serve cold.
            The first thing to do is make the marinade for the prawns. Chop up a garlic clove, a green chili and a spring onion into bits (just the stalk not the leaves) and put in a bowl.
            Add several large tablespoons of sesame oil to the bowl and blend using a hand blender (blending the marinade is optional). Alternatively, put in a blender jug.
            Add the prawns to the bowl with the oil and mix thoroughly. Add more oil if required to ensure that there is enough to soak into the prawns.
            Cover the bowl and put into the fridge to marinate for 15 minutes or ideally at least an hour. Halfway through that time give the prawns a good stir to ensure even coverage of the marinade.
            In the meantime, wash brown rice in a saucepan, cover with water, turn on heat to bring to boil. Once boiling turn down the heat and keep simmering for about 20 to 30 minutes. For rice noodles or quinoa check the pack in advance for cooking instructions and follow them, keeping timing in mind.
            Once rice is on to boil, wash all veg and chop into small even pieces and keep aside.
            In a wok, add some extra virgin olive oil and fry some chilis and spring onion pieces until very hot.
            Get the prawns out of the fridge and put into the wok. (Take care in case the oil spits). Cook the prawns for about 5 minutes until they are partway cooked, and remove from the pan to put aside. Leave the sesame oil in the pan if possible as it will flavour the veg.
            Add a tiny bit more oil to the wok if required and heat up. Cook the chili and garlic and add all the veg and stir thoroughly. Add the sesame seeds, if using.
            Add salt and stir veg around for about 5 minutes. Add the prawns back into the pan and keep cooking until vegetables are done, but preferably they should still have a slight crunch to them. Keep tasting the veg to check for seasoning and crunchiness.
            Keep an eye on the rice and when done drain and serve up with the stirfry. Add pickles and poppadoms on the side or a nice salad.
            In a bowl, combine the cream cheese with cucumber and squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon into the mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir well. Spread half of the mixture evenly into small serving glasses.
            Add the mint leaves to the remaining mixture and stir. Evenly distribute between the glasses.
            Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
            Put the squash and butter in a pan with 5 tbsp water. Cover and cook for 15 mins until the squash is tender. Mash with seasonin, generous amount of nutmeg and the grated parmesan (this is the stage you can put in fridge if preparing in advance)
            Boil a pan of water with a generous pinch of saffron and some salt for 5 mins. Fry the mushrooms in the remaining oil. When the are nearly cooked, add the garlic so it browns and crisps but doesnt burn. Wilt the spinach in the microwave or a pan for approx 1 min. Reheat the squash if you need to at this stage.
            Boil the lasagne in the saffron water for 1 min until just tender and drain. Take 2 warm plates and put a layer of spinach just slightly smaller than the lasagne on the bottom. Top with a square of lasagne, then a spread over a spoonful of squash, and add a few spinach leaves and then another square of pasta. Continue this until you have 4 layers of lasagne, then top off with a spoonful of squash.
            Scatter round the garlic mushrooms, spoon over the dressing or you could put this in a bowl and allow guests to do their own, and top off with parmesan shavings.</item>
